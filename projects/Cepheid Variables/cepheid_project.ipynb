    "## Background\n",
    "Measuring distances is difficult. Unlike on earth where we can just take out a measuring tape, Astronomers have to figure out standards of distance; these standards make up what is known as the Distance Ladder and allow us to measure distances across space with great accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](distance_ladder.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "One way we can think about measuring distance is with starlight. As you get further from an object, say a light bulb, it appears dimmer; as you move closer, it appears brighter. The brightness we measure drops off as an *inverse square law* where we have:\n",
    "$ F = \\frac{L}{4\\pi{r^2}}$.\n",
    "Here, $F$ is the apparent brightness of a star, $L$ is its intrinsic brightness (also known as luminosity), and $r$ is our distance from it.  \n",
    "#### Therefore, if you know the intrinisc brightness of a star, you can measure its distance based on what you measure as its apparent brightness on Earth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Astronomers, however, often think of brightness in a (confusing) magnitude scale, where larger magnitudes are dimmer and smalller (or more negative) magnitudes represent brighter sources. Astronomers have created the *distance modulus* to represent the *inverse square law* behaviour of starlight in the magnitude scale:\n",
    "### $m - M = 5\\log_{10}(\\frac{d}{10 \\textrm{pc}})$\n",
    "where $m$ is its apparent magnitude (what we see), $M$ is its intrinsic magnitude, and $d$ is its distance in parsecs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your project, you will be working with Cepheid variables, an important rung of the distance ladder for calibrating distances at *extragalactic scales*. A Cepheid variable is a type of regularly pulsating star with pulsation periods on the order of days to months. In the 1800s while studying a collection of Cepheid variables in a Milky Way satelite galaxy, Henrietta Swan Leavitt discovered that the *logarithm of the pulsation period of Cepheids is lineary related to its intrinsic luminosity*. Therefore, if we observe a Cepheid, we can figure out its intrinsic lumunoisty from its pulsation period, and thus know its distance from the *inverse square law* relationship. Edwin Hubble used Leavitt's Cepheid period relation to find the distance to our nearest galaxy, Andromeda (M31) and proving that M31 is in fact a seperate galaxy from the Milky Way, not a dusty nebular cloud.\n",

    "## Why do we care about distances in astronomy?\n",
    "\n",
    "For centuries, astronomers debated on the true nature of some fuzzy looking things on the dark night sky. In the mid 1700s, philosopher Immanual Kant proposed the idea of so-called \"island universes\"--galaxies existing independently from the Milky Way. However until the early 1900s, the Milky Way Galaxy was thought to be the end all be all for our universe. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then came the pivotal \"Great Debate of 1920\", where astronomers Harlow Shapely and Heber Curtis clashed over the true size of our universe. Harlow Shapely was convinced that the Milky Way Galaxy was all there was, until 1925 when Edwin Hubble calculated the distance to M31 (also known as Andromeda Galaxy) and proved that this object was too far away to be within the Milky Way Galaxy. With this discovery, Hubble essentially expanded the size of the known universe by a factor of a million. Allegedly, Hubble sent Shapely a letter showing his calculations, to which Shapely showed his colleague and remarked \"here is the letter that destroyed my universe.\"\n",
